Information for my game "Decaying Spawn" on Roblox.
WARNINGS! : FINISHED VERSION WILL HAVE THOUSANDS OF PARTS : : THE GAME WILL LAG AND PERFORM UNWELL ON LOW-END DEVICES : : I ADVISE YOU TO PLAY THE GAME ALONE (IN A PRIVATE SERVER), PLAYING WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE OR FRIENDS WILL POSSIBLY GLITCH THE GAME :

There is lore, but it's not much that you will need to do, to figure it out.

A haven turned decrepit? Why would you want to explore that?
